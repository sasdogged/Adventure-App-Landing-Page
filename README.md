# Simple Adventure App Landing Page

- Adventure App is a single-page landing site built in React, deployed on Vercel. It’s a portfolio project that showcases an imaginary travel/adventure app, made to test and consolidate the React skills I’ve learned so far.

  ## 🚀 Why I Built This
  - It’s my first solo React project — created to challenge myself and practice React fundamentals.
  - I used it as a sandbox to apply new knowledge: components, props, state (where needed), styling, and deployment.
  - It’s also a way to showcase that I can build something polished and live.
 
  ## 💡 Features / What’s in the App
   - Header and Navigation section
  - Call to Action (CTA): Designed to drive user engagement.
  - Responsive layout: Looks good on desktop and mobile.
  - Hero section: Engaging header to hook users.
  - Feature sections: To highlight the key value propositions of the (hypothetical) app.
  - Footer: Basic links / copyright.
 
    ## 🛠️ Built With
    - React — for building UI components
    - CSS — for styling (or Tailwind / SCSS / whatever you used)
    - Vercel — for deployment
